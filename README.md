# Data Analysis and Visualization for Amazon UK Grocery Dataset

Overview

This project focuses on analysing and visualizing the Amazon UK Grocery dataset to gain insights into various aspects of this marketplace. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to explore brand performance, revenue trends, product performance, relationships among variables, and customer buying behaviour. Through insightful visualizations and analysis, we seek to uncover valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making and drive business growth.

Introduction

In this project, we present a comprehensive approach to analysing and visualizing the Amazon UK Grocery dataset. Starting from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning to creating insightful visualizations and interpreting findings, we provide a detailed overview of key trends and patterns in the Amazon UK Grocery marketplace.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises historical data from Amazon UK Grocery, including various features such as product details, sales, revenue, ratings, price etc. The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers before being used for visualization and analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves analysing the dataset to gain insights into its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, we explore the data to understand its characteristics and identify patterns.

Data Visualization

Various data visualization techniques are employed to visually represent key insights and relationships within the dataset. Plots, charts, and graphs are utilized to communicate findings effectively and facilitate understanding. Techniques such as time series analysis, scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps are used to visualize revenue trends, product performance, brand preferences, relationships among variables and customer behaviour.

Data Cleaning

Data cleaning focuses on identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers to ensure the quality and integrity of the data.


Insights and Interpretation

By examining various dimensions of the dataset, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can inform marketing strategies, product development, and customer engagement initiatives.
